HTML table-based Selenium tests are here.

The WebDriver interfaces for Python and Ruby don't support
keyPress directly, but Selenium RC works. Right now I'm running
these tests directly with Selenium IDE in Firefox. Later
we'll try to standardize on something to run the tests
from the command line.
